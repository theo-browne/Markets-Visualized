Welcome to Markets Visualized.

Markets Visualized was designed to visualize the S&P 500 (a major US Stock index that includes most of the major public companies). The circle pack on the left of the page represents the companies, and sectors of the S&P 500 nested inside the largest circle representing the entire index. The innermost circles represent companies, with the size of the circle representing the market capitalization (value) of the company. The size of these company circles combine to dictate the size of the sector's circle. Together, these circles help users understand what how big these companies and sectors are in relation to each other as well as how they fit together to form the overall index. By clicking on different circles, users receive more information on that company/sector.

### How it Works

------

* Markets Visualized is created using D3.js, Chart.js, and Javascript.
* D3.js is used to create the large circle pack on the right of the screen .
* Chart.js is used to create the donut chart that represents the currently selected sector.
* The changes made to the site are done using vanilla Javascript DOM manipulation.
